This advanced Android nanodegree project deals with how to build clean and compelling user interfaces (UIs), fetch and parse data from network services, and optimize the experience for various mobile devices. 

Specific goals of this project: 

Present the user with a grid arrangement of movie posters upon launch using third party image processing libraries like Picasso/Glide. 
Allow your user to change sort order via a setting (Preferences/Menu items). The sort order can be by most popular or by highest-rated
Allow the user to tap on a movie poster and transition to a details screen with additional information such as:
 - original title
 - movie poster image thumbnail
 - A plot synopsis (called overview in the api)
 - user rating (called vote_average in the api)
 - release date
